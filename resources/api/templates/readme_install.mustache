## Getting started üê£

Using this client assumes that you have already created an App Search account on https://swiftype.com/ or you have a [self managed version](https://swiftype.com/documentation/app-search/self-managed/overview) of App Search available.

You can install the client in your project by using composer:

```bash
composer require elastic/app-search
```

### Versioning

 This client is versioned and released alongside App Search.

 To guarantee compatibility, use the most recent version of this library within the major version of the corresponding App Search implementation.

 For example, for App Search `7.3`, use `7.3` of this library or above, but not `8.0`.

 If you are a [SaaS](https://app.swiftype.com/as) user, simply use the most recent version of this library.
